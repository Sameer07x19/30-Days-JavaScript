## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 14

### Overview
On Day 14, I focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript. This included working with classes, inheritance, prototypes, getters and setters, and private fields. These concepts are foundational for structuring reusable and maintainable code.

---

### What I Learned
#### **1. Classes and Inheritance**
- **Task 1:** Created a `Person` class with a constructor and instance methods.
- **Task 3:** Extended the `Person` class to create a `Student` class using the `extends` keyword and `super()` for inheriting parent properties and methods.

#### **2. Prototypes**
- **Task 2:** Added a method dynamically to the `Person` prototype to update the `age` property.
- **Task 4:** Overrode the `greeting()` method for the `Student` class using the prototype.

#### **3. Static Properties and Methods**
- **Task 5:** Added a static method `greet` to the `Person` class, accessible without creating an instance.
- **Task 6:** Introduced a static property `count` in the `Student` class to track the number of student objects created.

#### **4. Getters and Setters**
- **Task 7 & 8:** Used getters to create a `name` property and setters to update the `firstname` and `lastname` properties dynamically.

#### **5. Private Fields**
- **Task 9 & 10:** Implemented encapsulation using private fields (`#balance`) in an `Account` class. Methods were provided to interact with these fields securely.

### Key Highlights
1. **Encapsulation**: Used private fields to protect sensitive data like `#balance` in the `Account` class.
2. **Inheritance**: Leveraged inheritance to reuse and extend functionality from a parent class.
3. **Static Members**: Understood the importance of static properties and methods that are independent of class instances.
4. **Getters and Setters**: Improved code readability and functionality by utilizing `get` and `set` for dynamic data access and modification.

### Additional Notes
Day 14 reinforced OOP principles and their implementation in JavaScript. These concepts are essential for building scalable applications and working with frameworks like React and Node.js.
