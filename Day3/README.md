## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 3

### Overview
On the third day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I practiced working with conditional statements, switch cases, and ternary operators. These concepts are crucial for making decisions in code and controlling the flow of execution based on different conditions.

### What I Learned
1. **Conditional Statements**:
   - Used `if-else` statements to evaluate conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the conditions.
   - Implemented functions to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero; to determine voting eligibility based on age; and to find the largest number among three numbers.

2. **Switch Cases**:
   - Applied `switch` statements to execute code based on the current day of the week and to determine grades based on marks.

3. **Ternary Operator**:
   - Utilized the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions, such as checking if a number is even or odd.

4. **Leap Year Calculation**:
   - Created a function to check if a given year is a leap year, using nested `if-else` statements for the logic.

### Additional Notes
Day 3 helped enhance my understanding of decision-making in JavaScript, which is essential for writing dynamic and responsive code.
