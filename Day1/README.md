## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 1

### Overview
On the first day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I focused on the basics of JavaScript, including variable declarations, data types, and console output. These are the building blocks for any JavaScript programming.

### What I Learned
1. **Variable Declarations**:
   - Learned the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` for declaring variables.

2. **Data Types**:
   - Worked with different data types like numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays.

3. **Console Methods**:
   - Used `console.log` to display values and `console.table` to show data types in a table format.

4. **Constants**:
   - Understood that variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned.

### Additional Notes
Day 1 provided a solid foundation in JavaScript basics, which are essential for any further development in the language.
