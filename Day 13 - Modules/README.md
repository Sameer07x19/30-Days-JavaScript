## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 13

### Overview
On the thirteenth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I explored various aspects of working with modules, third-party libraries, and making HTTP requests. This day was dedicated to understanding module exports, importing functionalities, and integrating external libraries into JavaScript projects.

### What I Learned
1. **Modules and Exports**:
   - Imported and used functions and objects from custom modules (`module1`, `module2`, `module3`, `module4`, `module5`) in the main script.
   - Demonstrated different ways to export and import functionalities in Node.js, such as exporting functions, objects, and destructuring module exports.

2. **External Libraries**:
   - Utilized the `lodash` library to perform array operations, such as calculating the sum and mean of an array.
   - Integrated the `axios` library to make HTTP requests, handling responses and errors using `async`/`await`.

3. **Error Handling in Async Operations**:
   - Managed errors from HTTP requests with `axios` and provided meaningful error messages.

### Additional Notes
Day 13 enhanced my understanding of modular programming in Node.js, the usage of third-party libraries, and handling asynchronous operations effectively. These skills are essential for structuring scalable applications and integrating external tools.
