## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 12

### Overview
On the twelfth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I focused on error handling, custom errors, and integrating error handling with asynchronous operations. This day emphasized understanding how to manage and handle errors effectively in JavaScript.

### What I Learned
1. **Error Handling with `try...catch`**:
   - Used `try...catch` blocks to handle runtime errors, including cases where variables are undefined or operations result in unexpected outcomes.
   - Implemented `finally` blocks to execute code regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

2. **Custom Errors**:
   - Created and threw custom error classes to handle specific types of errors more effectively.
   - Demonstrated the use of custom error messages in functions to validate inputs.

3. **Asynchronous Error Handling**:
   - Managed errors in promises using `.catch()` and integrated error handling in asynchronous functions with `async`/`await`.
   - Dealt with failed fetch requests and simulated random errors for promise-based tasks.

### Additional Notes
Day 12 provided a deeper understanding of JavaScript's error handling mechanisms and their application in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts, which is crucial for building robust applications.
