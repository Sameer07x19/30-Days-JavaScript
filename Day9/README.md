## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 9

### Overview
On the ninth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I focused on manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model). DOM manipulation is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

### What I Learned
1. **Selecting and Modifying Elements**:
   - Used `getElementById` and `getElementsByClassName` to select elements and modify their styles and content.
   
2. **Creating and Appending Elements**:
   - Created new HTML elements with `createElement` and appended them to the DOM using `appendChild`.
   - Used `createTextNode` for optimized text node creation and appending.

3. **Manipulating Lists**:
   - Added new list items to an existing list with `querySelector` and `appendChild`.

4. **Removing Elements**:
   - Removed elements from the DOM using `querySelector` and `remove`.

5. **Handling Attributes**:
   - Used `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute` to modify element attributes.
   - Changed the `alt` attribute of an image element.

6. **Event Handling**:
   - Added event listeners to handle `click` and `mouseover` events, dynamically changing content and styles based on user interaction.

### Additional Notes
Day 9 provided hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, which is crucial for building interactive web applications.
