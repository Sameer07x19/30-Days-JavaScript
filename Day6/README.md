## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 6

### Overview
On the sixth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I delved into working with arrays and performing various operations on them. Arrays are a fundamental part of JavaScript, essential for handling collections of data.

### What I Learned
1. **Array Basics**:
   - Created an array of numbers and practiced accessing the first and last elements.

2. **Array Modification**:
   - Used `push` to add an element to the end of the array and `pop` to remove the last element.
   - Applied `shift` to remove the first element and `unshift` to add an element to the beginning.

3. **Array Methods**:
   - Utilized `map` to create a new array by multiplying each element by 2.
   - Employed `filter` to create a new array with only even numbers.
   - Applied `reduce` to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

4. **Iteration**:
   - Iterated over the array using a `for` loop and `forEach` method to log each element.

5. **Multidimensional Arrays**:
   - Worked with a 2D array and accessed elements within nested arrays.

### Additional Notes
Day 6 strengthened my understanding of array operations, which are crucial for managing and manipulating data efficiently in JavaScript. These skills are foundational for tackling more complex data structures and algorithms in the future.
