## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 6

### Overview
On the sixth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I focused on arrays and how to use them effectively in JavaScript.

### What I Learned
1. **Array Basics **:
   - Created an array of numbers and accessed the first and last elements.

2. **Array Modification**:
   - Added and removed elements using `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift`.

3. **Array Methods**:
   - Used `map` to double each element.
   - Used `filter` to get even numbers.
   - Used `reduce` to sum all elements.

4. **Iteration**:
   - Iterated over the array with `for` loop and `forEach`.

5. **Multidimensional Arrays**:
   - Worked with a 2D array and accessed nested elements.

### Additional Notes
Day 6 helped me understand how to work with arrays, an essential part of managing data in JavaScript.
