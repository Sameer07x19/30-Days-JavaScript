## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 5

### Overview
On the fifth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I focused on creating and utilizing functions, including arrow functions, to perform a variety of tasks. This practice helped me to understand the importance of functions in structuring and reusing code effectively.

### What I Learned
1. **Function Creation**:
   - Created traditional functions to determine if a number is even or odd, calculate the square of a number, and find the maximum of two numbers.

2. **String Manipulation**:
   - Implemented a function to concatenate two strings.

3. **Arrow Functions**:
   - Used arrow functions to sum two numbers, check if a string includes a specific character, perform multiplication with default parameters, and generate personalized greetings.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**:
   - Developed higher-order functions to calculate the area of a circle and perform combined operations like addition and multiplication.

### Additional Notes
Day 5 enhanced my understanding of functions and their importance in writing clean, efficient, and reusable code. By practicing with different types of functions and parameters, I am better prepared to handle more complex coding challenges.
