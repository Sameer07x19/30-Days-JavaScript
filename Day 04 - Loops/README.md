## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 4

### Overview
On the fourth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I focused on mastering iterative structures and control flow mechanisms to enhance my programming skills.

### Tasks Completed
1. **For Loop**: Iterated through numbers from 1 to 10.
2. **For Loop with Multiplication**: Printed multiplication tables for 5.
3. **While Loop for Summation**: Calculated the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
4. **While Loop for Countdown**: Counted down from 10 to 1 using a `while` loop.
5. **Do-While Loop**: Printed numbers from 1 to 5 using a `do-while` loop.
6. **Factorial Calculation**: Calculated the factorial of 5 using a `do-while` loop.
7. **Nested For Loop**: Printed patterns of asterisks in increasing rows using nested `for` loops.
8. **For Loop with Continue Statement**: Skipped number 5 in a loop using `continue`.
9. **For Loop with Break Statement**: Stopped the loop when reaching number 7 using `break`.

### Additional Notes
Day 4 was dedicated to practicing various loop structures and understanding how to control program flow with `continue` and `break` statements in JavaScript.
