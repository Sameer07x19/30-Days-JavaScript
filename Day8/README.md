## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 8

### Overview
On the eighth day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I delved into modern JavaScript features, including template literals, destructuring, and the spread/rest operators.

### What I Learned
1. **Template Literals**:
   - Utilized template literals to embed variables and expressions into strings.
   - Practiced multi-line strings using backticks.

2. **Destructuring Assignment**:
   - Used array destructuring to extract values from arrays into variables.
   - Applied object destructuring to extract properties from objects into variables.

3. **Spread Operator**:
   - Combined arrays using the spread operator.
   - Created new arrays by spreading the elements of existing arrays.

4. **Rest Operator**:
   - Used the rest operator in function parameters to handle an indefinite number of arguments.

5. **Default Parameters**:
   - Set default values for function parameters.

6. **Enhanced Object Literals**:
   - Utilized property value shorthand and method definitions in objects.
   - Employed computed property names to create dynamic object properties.

### Additional Notes
Day 8 was all about leveraging modern JavaScript features to write cleaner, more efficient code.
