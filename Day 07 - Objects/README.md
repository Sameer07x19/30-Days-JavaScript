## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 7

### Overview
On the seventh day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I focused on working with objects in JavaScript, which are key to organizing and managing data.

### What I Learned
1. **Basic Object Creation**:
   - Created a simple object with properties like `title`, `author`, and `year`.

2. **Accessing Object Properties**:
   - Accessed and logged individual properties of an object.

3. **Object Methods**:
   - Added methods to objects to perform actions, such as returning a description of a book.

4. **Updating Object Properties**:
   - Updated the year property of an object using a method.

5. **Nested Objects and Arrays**:
   - Created a `library` object containing an array of books, each represented by an object.

6. **Iterating Over Objects**:
   - Iterated over an object's properties using `for...in`.

7. **Object Methods with Array Methods**:
   - Used `map` within an object method to log details of each book.

8. **Object Built-in Methods**:
   - Explored `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, and `Object.entries` to work with object properties.

### Additional Notes
Day 7 was all about mastering objects, a crucial aspect of JavaScript for structuring and managing complex data.
