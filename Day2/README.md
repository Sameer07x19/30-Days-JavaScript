## 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge: Day 2

### Overview
On the second day of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, I worked on various arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. These are basic yet essential concepts in programming, which help in building more complex logic.

### What I Learned
1. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Learned how to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.

2. **Assignment Operators**:
   - Used `+=` to add to a variable and `-=` to subtract from a variable.

3. **Comparison Operators**:
   - Compared values using `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` to see how they relate to each other.

4. **Equality Operators**:
   - Explored the difference between `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality).

5. **Logical Operators**:
   - Used `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) to combine conditions.

6. **Ternary Operator**:
   - Used the ternary operator to quickly evaluate a condition and return a value.

### Additional Notes
Day 2 helped solidify my understanding of basic JavaScript operations. These concepts are fundamental for writing any kind of JavaScript code.
